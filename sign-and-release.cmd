title Sign and Release - Kivun Terminal

REM  Signs the Windows installer with your Certum "Code Signing
REM  Individual in Cloud" certificate and uploads the SIGNED copy
REM  onto the GitHub release (replacing the unsigned one GitHub built).

REM  BEFORE double-clicking: open SimplySign Desktop and log in
REM  (enter the 6-digit code from your phone). The private key lives
REM  in Certum's cloud, so signing only works while that app is
REM  logged in. See ..\..\Certification\SIGNING_GUIDE.md
